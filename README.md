# Git-Topo-Sort

The topo_order_commits.py script analyzes a Git repository by constructing a commit graph from branch references and commit objects, without invoking Git commands. It then produces a deterministic topological ordering of commits, formatting the output with sticky starts and sticky ends to indicate parent-child relationships.
